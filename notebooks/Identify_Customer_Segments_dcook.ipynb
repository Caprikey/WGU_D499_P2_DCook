These segments can then be used to direct marketing campaigns towards audiences that will have the highest expected rate of returns. The data that you will use has been provided by our partners at Bertelsmann Arvato Analytics, and represents a real-life data science task.\n",

In each step of the project, you will see some text describing the subtask that you will perform, followed by one or more code cells for you to complete your work. **Feel free to add additional code and markdown cells as you go along so that you can explore everything in precise chunks.** The code cells provided in the base template will outline only the major tasks, and will usually not be enough to cover all of the minor tasks that comprise it.\n",

In real-life tasks, there may be many valid ways to approach an analysis task. One of the most important things you can do is clearly document your approach so that other scientists can understand the decisions you've made.\n",

In these cells, you will report your findings for the completed section, as well as document the decisions that you made in your approach to each subtask. **Your project will be evaluated not just on the code used to complete the tasks outlined, but also your communication about your observations and conclusions at each stage.**"

You will use this information to cluster the general population into groups with similar demographic properties. Then, you will see how the people in the customers dataset fit into those created clusters. The hope here is that certain clusters are over-represented in the customers data, as compared to the general population; those over-represented clusters will be assumed to be part of the core userbase. This information can then be used for further applications, such as targeting for a marketing campaign.\n",

Also, considering the size of the main dataset, it may take some time for it to load completely.\n",

    "#### Discussion 1.1.2: Assess Missing Data in Each Column\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important that we start by defining what an 'Outlier' is.  In Mathematic and Statistics, an 'Outlier' is defined as a data point that significantly deviates from the other data points in a set. \n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, we would define a column as an 'outlier' if said column contains a significantly larger amount of data that is considered missing compared to the rest of the columns in the dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is not to say that missing data is not expected or at least not necessarily a sign of a larger problem or bad/invalid data, our dataset is actually a perfect example of this. Earlier, you will recall when we begin by importing our dataset, we designated that any naturally missing values in the data were to be assigned as a Numpy NaN (np.NaN) value. \n",
    "\n",
    "From there, we then took it a step further and converted any values that were purposefully used to label data that was considered \"missing\", \"unknown\", \"unspecified\" into the same Numpy NaN value, effectively taking actual present data and turning them into Numpy NaN (missing) data. \n",
    "\n",
    "We did this because in our use-case we are attempting to train an Unsupervised Machine Learning model, and we cannot have missing value in our dataset. Furthermore, any area where we can remove obvious signs of irrelevant data, such as data that holds no weight (like an entirely empty column), will make our training faster and result in more performant models. \n",
    "\n",
    "With that said, let's dive into how I determined what was an outlier and what columns were identified. \n",
    "\n",
    "In my exploratory data analysis, I am being by calculating the sum of total number of missing values per column. Then I took that sum and divided it by the total length of the column to create a percentage of total NaN values per column or the mean of the column's NaN. From here, I converted that number percentage to a score value by dividing it by 100, called the missing score and then created a baseline number by taking the average or mean of the all the missing scores. Using said baseline, I finished by assigning each column with a category that indicated the level of missing values, which I called this category the severity levels ( 'Very Low', 'Low', 'Medium Low', 'Medium', 'Medium High', 'High', 'Very High'). The level was determined by how far above or below the missing score was from the baseline mean that was just created. \n",
    "\n",
    "To make the entire process easier, I created a function to perform all the steps above and store them in a dataframe that can be reviewed or referenced if needed, which is shown above. Not only this, but my function also references the features summary and captures some extra details about each column, such as the level of data, and type of data it is, as well performing an export a list of the columns that were labeled as Outliers to a separate file to be used later. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, I decided that any column that was assigned with a severity level of 'Medium High', 'High', or 'Very High' would be considered Outlier Columns. This resulted in a total of six columns that were labeled as outlier columns, or columns with abnormally high NaN percentages, they were:\n",
    "1. TITEL_KZ\n",
    "2. AGER_TYP\n",
    "3. KK_KUNDENTYP\n",
    "4. KBA05_BAUMAX\n",
    "5. GEBURTSJAHR\n",
    "6. ALTER_HH\n",
    " \n",
    "Our exploratory data analysis shows that the average missing amount of data in each column is roughly 15.40%. These six columns above contain a range between 35% and almost 100% missing data. Three of the columns, TITEL_KZ, AGER_TYP, GEBURTSJAHR, are of the People information level. Two of the columns, ALTER_HH and KK_KUNDENTYP, are from the Household information level. The last column, KBA05_BAUMAX, comes from the RR3 mirco-cell level of information. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using the Data Dictionary, we can interpret that there is strong possibly of a correlation or at least link between the AGER_TYP, GEBURTSJAHR, and ALTER_HH features. Each of these features deal with the age of the consumer, AGER_TYPE attempts to define an elderly typology, the GEBURTSJAHR is defining the consumers year of birth, and the ALTER_HH wants to know what date range the head of household's age falls in. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the TITEL_KZ and KBA05_BAUMAX columns, I believe their missing values follow a relatively easily prediction pattern, allow me to explain. In the TITEL_KZ column, we are indicating what level of advanced higher education degree the consumer has obtained, a Doctorate, Multiple Doctorates, Professor status, Professor Status with a Doctorate, or something similar. It is far more likely that the average consumer will not have a higher education degree. The KBA05_BAUMAX column wants to know how many and of what type of buildings exist in their Residental Rural 3 (RR3) microcell. If this information was obtained from the consumer directly/semi-indirectly, I would not expect this information to be known. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally for the KK_KUNDENTYP column, this column inquiries from the user what pattern of a consumer have they been over the last 12 months. I could see this information being left out if the question was worded poorly when obtained or even intentionally left blank to prevent any potential consequence for providing feedback, i.e. If the information was gathered from a brand or service the customer likes but happens to use sparsely, they may not want to review the limited use in case that has a detrimental impact on the company-consumer relationship, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "Regardless of the main reason, these columns have to go due to the amount of missing data, and so they were removed from the dataframe and exported to the archive_data directory for potential future research. \n",
    "\n",
    "After removing the outlier columns, we have now reduced our dataset from a total of 85 features down to 79 features. If we look back, we can see that in the beginning we had a total of 62 columns that contained missing data, but now with the six columns removed we are down to 56 columns that contain at least one missing item and 23 columns that contain 0. With that said, let's now turn our attention to the remaining columns that contained missing data and see if we can determine if there are any potential patterns. \n",
    "\n",
    "At initial glance, we can see a strong, potential pattern or correlation/relationship between at least several groups of features, based on the amount of missing data. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first of these groups contains seven features, which are: \"PLZ8_ANTG1\", \"PLZ8_ANTG2\", \"PLZ8_ANTG3\", \"PLZ8_ANTG4\", \"PLZ8_HHZ\", \"PLZ8_BAUMAX\", \"PLZ8_GBZ\". All seven of these features are from the same information level, macrocell_plz8, and have the exact same amount of missing data, 116,515 items or 13.0736%. \n",
    "\n",
    "The second of these groups contains six features, which are: \"KBA05_ANTG1\", \"KBA05_ANTG2\", \"KBA05_ANTG3\", \"KBA05_ANTG4\", \"KBA05_GBZ\", and \"MOBI_REGIO\". All six contain exactly 133,324 missing items or 14.9597% missing data. However, five of these features are from the same information level, microcell_rr3, and \"MOBI_REGIO\" comes from the region_rr1 information level and is related to movement patterns not building type/count like the others. We can also see that most of these columns share a similar naming scheme as the ones from the first group. \n",
    "\n",
    "After this, we are still able to see groupings of data with the exact same number of missing items and from the same information level. I would even consider it appropriate to for some of these features to infer that the data is significantly interconnected in some manner, most likely at the point of capture or its purpose/representation in the dataset. An example of the former would be with the \"HEALTH_TYP\", \"SHOPPER_TYP\", and \"VERS_TYP\" features, each have the same amount missing 111,196 or 12.1366%, each deal with the person level of data, and each asks a question about the user/consumer. For the latter, we have features like \"LB_LEBENSPHASE_FEIN\" and \"LP_LEBENSPHASE_GROB\" or \"CAMEO_DEUG_2015\", \"CAMEO_DEU_2015\", and \"CAMEO_INTL_2015\" or \"GEBAEUDETYP\" and \"GEBAEUDETYP_RASTER\" and several others. These features have either the same or extremely little variance in the amount missing data and have very obvious connections based their naming and descriptions in the data dictionary, such as one feature represents the rough or high level overview of that feature and its counterpart feature provides fine or very granular level detail. \n",
    "\n",
    "These groupings described above make up approximately roughly half of the remaining 56 columns. This initial inspection does not imply that these are an exact one to one value link (meaning the value that is missing in one group is a direct link to the other), this is just a high-level review of missing data and interpretation of the numbers. If necessary, a more in-depth analysis could be conducted into each column and the distribution of the missing values overall between all columns or even correlation studies on the features relationship. However, for now we are going to move forward with data cleanup and model training and circle back around to the process improvement/quality control aspects another time. \n"

    "#### Step 1.1.3: Assess Missing Data in Each Row\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, you'll perform a similar assessment for the rows of the dataset. How much data is missing in each row? As with the columns, you should see some groups of points that have a very different numbers of missing values. Divide the data into two subsets: one for data points that are above some threshold for missing values, and a second subset for points below that threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to know what to do with the outlier rows, we should see if the distribution of data values on columns that are not missing data (or are missing very little data) are similar or different between the two groups.

    "- You can use seaborn's [`countplot()`](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.countplot.html) function to create a bar chart of code frequencies and matplotlib's [`subplot()`](https://matplotlib.org/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.subplot.html) function to put bar charts for the two subplots side by side.\n",

If the distributions of non-missing features look similar between the data with many missing values and the data with few or no missing values, then we could argue that simply dropping those points from the analysis won't present a major issue. On the other hand, if the data with many missing values looks very different from the data with few or no missing values, then we should make a note on those data as special. We'll revisit these data later on. **Either way, you should continue your analysis for now using just the subset of the data with few or no missing values.**"

    "#### Discussion 1.1.3: Assess Missing Data in Each Row\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous section, we identified and removed the features that contained the majority of the missing data, the outlier columns. We also noted in the previous section that roughly two-thirds of  our updated dataset still contained missing values interdispersed throughout the features. As we stated before, these missing values are not necessarily an issue since we have translated values that were purposeful labeled as \"missing\", \"unknown\", or \"unspecified\" into the same value that naturally missing values would be, Numpy NaN. Let's take a closer look into how these missing values are distributed throughout each of the rows throughout our dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "We started by taking our updated dataset and running some simple exploratory data analysis on it to get some rough figures. Using an EDA function I created, we will take a copy of our dataset and create two new columns and append them to the dataset. The first column will store the total number of features that contain a missing value in each row using the sum method, and we will save it into a new column called 'row_nan_total_sum'. The second column will be called 'row_nan_total_mean' and it will store the average number of missing values per row created using the mean method. This function then will print out some descriptive statistics using the describe method and return the new row nan eda dataframe and a value containing the length of the original dataframe calculated using the len function.  \n",
    "\n",
    "It is here that we can will pass the returned EDA dataframe into our plot functions, specifically the 'plot_hist_row_nan_eda_side_by_side'. This function creates two histograms side by side by plotting each of the previously created row nan columns. The first of these histograms shows us the average percentage of missing values from each row binned into groups. Here we can see that the majority of our columns have less than 10% missing data. The second column shows the total count of missing values per row as a summed total that has been binned as well. This column again validates that the majority of our missing data is less than 10 items per row. The second function we run displays the descriptive statistics generated from the describe method in a side by side dataframe as well. Our visual analysis is further backed up by these stats. We can see that on average missing per row in the proportional eda is roughly 7% missing data from each row with a deviation of 16% in this mean. Our upper quartile of missing data is less than 4%. The average missing in our count totals per row is roughly 6 items, with a deviation of roughly 13 items. The max value see was 49 items, which is 62% of the row, and our upper quartiles have 3 items missing per row. \n",
    "\n",
    "This gives us some good idea of how our missing data is distributed. Howevver, let's take it a step further and work towards the isolation and removal of rows that would be considered subpar from a quality stand-point. To do this, we are going to start by dividing our dataset into two parts, one for the rows with a low percentage of missing data and the other for rows for rows that we have determined have a high amount of missing data. However, how should we divided our dataset? Should we divide using a hard-coded maximum value? Should we dynamically calculate the ideal amount? What about quanity? How much data loss from removal is acceptable? These are all really good questions to have when approaching a problem such as this. \n",
    "\n",
    "There really isn't a one size fits all solution and we have to be adaptable to resolve these. This is why I decided to take the more difficult approach and design a solution that would be dynamic in nature but also have some fallbacks or fail-safes in place. My solution attempts to dyanamically locate and assign a threshold value to divide my dataset into either low or high. It actually does it by utilizing a technique that we will cover more so later in the project, Clustering. We perform a KMeans clustering analysis on our dataframe. We do this by first converting our dataset into a series of the average percentage of nan values per row. We then reshape this data and pass it into our KMeans object. Once we have fit our data to the KMeans Object, we will extract the center values from our cluster object, and then sort and flatten them into a a list which we will obtain the average value of our centers. This value is what we will set as our optimal threshold value. Now that we have located what we believe is the optimal threshold value to safely divide our dataset into two, we then perform an comparision between the mean value of missing values per row in our dataset against our opitmal threshold value. This generates us a series of true and false values for which we will obtain the porition or average of our dataset that is above our threshold value. This average is then assigned to the 'actual_loss' variable. Why do we do this, this is the first step to one of my safe guards, the actual loss value represents how much of our dataset will be lost if we decided to split our dataset using that threshold value. How is this important you may ask? By knowing how much of our data will be removed by this threshold value, we are able to setup fallbacks to allow us to prevent against shrinking out dataset and affecting the overal quality of our data. It's extremely important to have good quality data, but having too small of a dataset can create issues of its own. So its a balancing act on how much of our data we should keep verus how good the quality of our data is. In my solution, I decided that I never wanted to lose more than 20% of my total data. So how is this used? Well if the threshold value we determiend using our Kmeans clustering analysis was found to create an actual loss of data greater than 20%, then what we will do is fall back to a hard coded threshold value we have set, which in our case is 10% maximum allowed missing data. What about if said hard coded threshold causes greater than 20% loss of data? In my current design, I have built my function to prioritize good quality data in quanitity size. However, if we end up in a fall back scenario due to maximium loss of data with our dynamic threshold value, then our priority scope will shift from a quanity focus to almost purely quality focused. Meaning we will filter out all rows that have greater than 10% missing data. \n",
    "\n",
    "So at this point, we have determined a threshold to divide our dataset, so let's do that using our obtained threshold value. To do this, my function then makes a copy of the dataset and creates a new column to hold the row nan mean value. We create a second column to hold a category value based on that rows mean value, if the value is above our threshold value, then the row is labeled as 'high' and if the value is lower than it is labeled as 'low'. Then we split the dataset into two subset based on the row's label. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have split the two datasets, let's compare them to see if they have any commonality or patterns to the distribution that we can see. To do this, we will create a new list containing only columns that exist in both datasets for a fair review. We do this by appending any column name that is found to exist in both dataframes.  It is here that you will notice that I have added a noise feature to my comparision. In my function, I added the ability to either accept only columns that have no missing values or the ability to define an acceptable percentage level of missing values per row in each column. If the values are above the accpetable level of noise then they are not included in the column comparision analysis, if the noise functionality is enabled. From there, we will save the list of column names for our next step. \n",
    "\n",
    "So now that we've split our dataframe into two subsets and obtained a list of columns that exists in both our low row nan eda dataframe and our high row nan dataframe, we can now graph and compare our results to see the distribution of values between the two dataset. We do this iterating through our list of common columns that we just generated previously with both our dataframes, creating a two figure plot using the countplot function for each column. \n",
    "\n",
    "In our analysis, the first thing that is noticable is that the values count are dramatically different. However, it is my opinion that this can be explained based on the differences in the dataset sample sizes. With that in mind, let's take another more close look at the data distribution and adjusted our perspective to compensate for the size difference. One the first things we notice is for the majority of our columns, we are able to see that data distributions are vastly different, almost inversly different. There are a few outliers in this analysis where the analysis appears similar like in the \"GREEN_AVANTGARDE\" and the \"ANDEDE_KZ\" column. \n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, when we look at the shape of the data distrubtion we are able to see that the low nan eda dataframe has more normal distributions shapes, the 'bell shape', there are some skewing and/or peaks but otherwise, I would say they are well spread. The high nan eda dataframe on the other hand has singular peaks or high skews to one side. It would be best to perform further indepth analysis into how the rows that have high values of missing data are associated with their relative high value columns, i.e. the singular peak columns of data in the the high nan eda dataframe. \n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, in the scope of this project, we have been instructed to remove the rows that we have identified to have high nan values for now and proceed further with our project. So that is what we will do. The high nan row eda dataset will be exported to the data\\archived folder and we will proceed forward with the low nan dataset. To do the split and export I have created a copy of the split eda function used prior but this one is designed to be used with the graph function and export function together in tandem instead of separately. \n",

    "### Step 1.2: Select and Re-Encode Features\n",
    "\n",
    "Checking for missing data isn't the only way in which you can prepare a dataset for analysis. Since the unsupervised learning techniques to be used will only work on data that is encoded numerically, you need to make a few encoding changes or additional assumptions to be able to make progress. In addition, while almost all of the values in the dataset are encoded using numbers, not all of them represent numeric values. Check the third column of the feature summary (`feat_info`) for a summary of types of measurement.\n",
    "- For numeric and interval data, these features can be kept without changes.\n",
    "- Most of the variables in the dataset are ordinal in nature. While ordinal values may technically be non-linear in spacing, make the simplifying assumption that the ordinal variables can be treated as being interval in nature (that is, kept without any changes).\n",
    "- Special handling may be necessary for the remaining two variable types: categorical, and 'mixed'.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first two parts of this sub-step, you will perform an investigation of the categorical and mixed-type features and make a decision on each of them, whether you will keep, drop, or re-encode each. Then, in the last part, you will create a new data frame with only the selected and engineered columns.\n",

    "Data wrangling is often the trickiest part of the data analysis process, and there's a lot of it to be done here. But stick with it: once you're done with this step, you'll be ready to get to the machine learning parts of the project!"

    "#### Discussion 1.2.1: Re-Encode Categorical Features\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For the next step of our project, we took a more close inspection into our dataset's features. We began this phase by first by identifying and categorizing our features based on the type of data they contain. We did this by passing our updated features summary dataframe into a function that would filter the dataframe by its 'data_type' column then output a list containing the names of all columns that were of that data type, as well as a summary dataframe that contained the value counts of each data_type. This means that ultimately, we ended up with one summary data frame and five lists (interval, numeric, ordinal, categorical, and mixed). \n",
    "\n",
    "Based on our value counts dataframe, we have 49 ordinal columns, 18 categorical, 6 mixed, and 6 numeric columns. First and foremost, we can see that we do not have any interval columns in our updated features summary dataframe, which indicates they were removed during the outlier isolation and removal. We will continue to generate this list as other datasets may have those data types, and with each part of this project I've attempted to build it as if it was a production product. With that said, let's continue on, we were instructed in the project that numeric and interval data can be left as is, and for this project, we should assume that the ordinal data is interval in nature and thus we do not have to modify this. With more time, I would like to circle back around and address this to make the project more universal and able to handle these typical cases and other edge cases. Now, with those columns removed, we have a remaning 24 columns out of the 79 that need to be addressed, 6 of these are mixed and the remaining 18 are categorical. \n",
    "\n",
    "To make the process more automated and robust, I developed a function that takes our dataframe and a predefined list of categorical columns to systematically group them based on an initial review of the data, classifying each as either binary or multi-level. The function does this by first creating three empty sets, one for binary, one for multi-level, and one to catch columns that failed to be identified. Then quite simply the function checks the numer of unique values that are within each column's data. If there is exactly two, the column is added to the binary set, if there is more than two, then it is added to the multi-level, and anything else is added to the error set, and returns these when finished. Sets are used to enusre the column names are immutable and no duplicates occur. Once we have our returned sets, we then pass them into the list function to make a list of the column names. We do this because later in the project we will want to be able to remove columns from the lists, since they were generated using the features summary dataframe and not our main dataframe, if they do not exist when performing function calls. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with our binary columns, we find that there are five columns that are binary, \"GREEN_AVANTGARDE\", \"SOHO_KZ\", \"OST_WEST_KZ\", \"ANREDE_KZ\", and \"VERS_TYP\". In the multi-level categories we identified 13 columns, which were: \"GFK_URLAUBERTYP\", \"CJT_GESAMTTYP\", \"LP_STATUS_FEIN\", \"LP_FAMILIE_GROB\", \"SHOPPER_TYP\", \"CAMEO_DEUG_2015\", \"CAMEO_DEU_2015\", \"LP_STATUS_GROB\", \"NATIONALITAET_KZ\", \"FINANZTYP\", \"ZABEOTYP\", \"LP_FAMILIE_FEIN\", \"GEBAEUDETYP\". For now, let's set the multi-level categorical columns to the side and switch back over to our binary category items. Moving back to our binary columns, the next check we perform is to see verify the type of value are stored in each column, more specifically if the column is of the int or float type or something else. Upon running this check we discover that the 'OST_WEST_KZ' column is the only one that contains non-numeric based values. All other ones are numirically based binary values. Using our data dictionary, we are able to determine that the 'OST_WEST_KZ' column uses the values \"O\" and \"W\" to distigush the historical land reference of the building for that consumer. For this column, we will need to re-encode the values to new ones. As for the other columns like 'VERS_TYP' and 'ANREDE_KZ' have numerical based binary values but they do not follow the typical binary format, instead of '0' and '1', they are '1' and '2'. We will map these to the proper values to keep a more uniform structure throughout our project. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we've completed our investigation, let's move to correcting these columns. For the 'OST_WEST_KZ' column we will create two new columns called 'OST_WEST_KZ_WEST' and 'OST_WEST_KZ_EST'. Next we will prefil these columns with '0' to handle the our unknown/missing data fields. We fill these nan values in now because by the end of our project we will need to have them removed anyways. It is a safe assumption that missing values can be consider false since we will be applying the false condition to both the new '..._KZ_WEST' and '..._KZ_EAST' columns. Next using the an index matching operation with a data conversion, we will overwrite our pre-fill with the proper matched row values. In the West column, all values that were \"W\" were marked at true and then converted to binary, resulting in a '1' value for each row where the index match evaluates true. Inversely, the East column matched any row value that was \"O\". Thus we have effectively encode this single column into two columns for each value in the column thhat contains a binary representation. In other words, we have manually performed the panda's get_dummies fuction, or more commonly known as one hot encoding. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the 'VERS_TYP' and 'ANREDE_KZ' columns, we will use the map function to remap the '1' values to '0' and the '2' values to '1' to align them with a more standardized format. Thus conluding our binary categorical columns work, we can now move on to our mutli-level categorical items. \n",
    "\n",
    "As stated before, for our multi-level categorical columns we found 13 of them. Again, using the Data dictionary we are able to determine that out of these 13 columns, we are been able to identify that there are six columns of importance, which are: \"LP_FAMILIE_GROB\", \"LP_FAMILIE_FEIN\", \"LP_STATUS_GROB\", \"LP_STATUS_FEIN\",\"CAMEO_DEUG_2015\", and \"CAMEO_DEU_2015\". These stand out from the other columns as they display a clear correlation or granulatity of the same data. For this columns, I will be handling them a certain way. As for the other columns, which were: \"GFK_URLAUBERTYP\", \"CJT_GESAMTTYP\", \"SHOPPER_TYP\",  \"NATIONALITAET_KZ\", \"FINANZTYP\", \"ZABEOTYP\", \"GEBAEUDETYP\", when we compare each value to it's meaning using the data dictionary, we are able to see that for the most part they are unique enough from each other. So what we will do is re-encode each of these columns values from the interger format into the string definition of the value, then convert it to a category data type. Then when we perform one-hot encoding later in the section, each of these columns will be converted in to a one hot encoding of it's value with more understandable names. \n",
    "\n",
    "With that said, I will be doing the same technique to the \"LP_STATUS_GROB\" and \"LP_FAMILIE_GROB\" columns. These two columns house a more highlevel overview of family type and social status. For a more granular level of detail we can look at their counterpart columns the   \"LP_FAMILIE_FEIN\" and the \"LP_STATUS_FEIN\". However, for this project's scope we are going to drop the granular data for now to keep the project a little more streamlined and simple. As for the \"CAMEO_DEUG_2015\" and \"CAMEO_DEU_2015\" these two also share a correlation between their data's meanings, but unlike the other four the data can be divided with a little bit less work. In the \"CAMEO_DEU_2015\" feature column we have data stored in a hexidecimal format, with the first character being a number and the second being a letter. The number is a direct correlation to the data in the \"CAMEO_DEUG_2015\" feature column, while the letter creates a division in the different wealth-life stage typology from within each core level. So for this column, I will be splitting the two digit values in half and keeping only the character letter. These can then be in junction with the the \"CAMEO_DEUG_2015\" column during our analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "As stated before, the final step for this phase is to perform one-hot encoding using the Pandas get_dummies function. Doing this will turn all of my original features colums from a single multi-value feature into multiple feature columns representing a binary state for each different unique value for each core feature. I perform this one-hot encoding on the correct columns by assigning my multilevel category list into a new list object then iterating over each item in that list applying the get_dummies function to it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now that our categorical items are done, we can move on to the mixed data features. \n"

    "#### Discussion 1.2.2: Engineer Mixed-Type Features\n",
    "\n",
    "In the sections above and below, we move to begin to analyze our mixed-values features to determine if they can be utilized through re-engineering or if for now, we should isolate and removed for now. Using the same list of columns prior, we can see that we have six mixed-value columns are: 'PRAEGENDE_JUGENDJAHRE', 'CAMEO_INTL_2015', 'LP_LEBENSPHASE_GROB', 'LP_LEBENSPHASE_FEIN', 'WOHNLAGE', and 'PLZ8_BAUMAX'. Using our Data dictionary to review each feature's data values, I believe that it is possible for use to keep five of the six features, and maintain their data's purpose to a relatively high degree. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the section above I performed the reengineering of the two required columns for this project, 'PRAEGENDE_JUGENDJAHRE' and. 'CAMEO_INTL_2015'. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the 'PRAEGENDE_JUGENDJAHRE' feature, we can see that there is at least three different types of data being represented within the feature's value. The values represent different time period's social-political movements that were occurring in the Germany. The first of these is the decade of consumer youth. The second of these is whether the political movement at the time was mainstream or avantgarde. The third of these indicates whether the assigned movement was occurring in only occurring in East Germany, only in West Germany, or in both (this include pre-fall and post-fall of the berlin wall). As instructed for this project, we will re-engineer this feature into two separate features, one to indicate the decade for the social-political movement and the other to indicate if the movement was main-stream or avant-garde. \n",
    "\n",
    "For now, the region of the movement will be excluded as instructed to do so, but it is my opinion that there is a chance that this column's representation could have been included. To do this, I believe that we could create two new columns to represent each region, east and west. From there, we could map the appropriate binary representation for each movement to their column, but then for columns that have both we would need to assign true values to both columns. However, the first issue with doing this is that Panda's get_dummies or one-hot encoding from sci-kit learn, do not allow for multiple true values in one-hot, but we may be able to use 'multi-label binarizer' from sci-kit learn instead to accomplish them. Otherwise, it's just simple manual mapping like we've been doing for the other categorical columns. I think the second issue would be the possibility that by attempting to include this data and splitting the column, we run the risk of introducing a false relationship between the different region features and the movement types. \n",
    "\n",
    "To re-engineer this feature, we started by creating two new columns for the feature, one for the decade and one for the movement type. To do this we start by making a dictionary and storing each of the feature's values as keys. Then for each key we provided an integer value that represented each decade, 1-6. Then for the movement type, we performed the same steps, created a dictionary the same size as our value count as the value, then assigned either a one or two for the movement type to indicate mainstream or avant-garde. The function I created to perform this also takes note of the original column's location in the dataframe and will pop the new columns and insert them into the dataset directly after the original column. This way I maintain some similarity to the original data structure. My function, if enable, then completes by removing the original column and performing one-hot encoding using Panda's get_dummies method. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the second column, 'CAMEO_INTL_2015', the process starts the same with a review of the data dictionary details. Here we see that this feature details the wealth to life stage typology for the consumer, or two different types of data. These values represent the different levels of wealth, as well as the life stage the consumer is currently in. We can see that there is a repeating pattern in the way the data is presented, which is that the first value represents the wealth level, and the second value represents the life-stage. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this column, my function will start by converting the entire column into string format. Then we create two new columns that will contain the value for wealth and for life stage and prefill them with nan values. Next, I create a mask that I apply to the whole column of data, checking for only numerical items. The next step is done by filtering the column and assigning the result to the corresponding new column. As we obtain the results of the index filter, we will apply our mask to them to ensure they are numbers then using string slicing take the first digit and insert it into the wealth column. We run this again, this time for the second-string item, with the same mask validation, apply those values to the second column for life-stage. Finally, my function will delete the original column after popping and inserting those columns to the correct position. Then apply one-hot encoding using Panda's get_dummies. \n",
    "\n",
    "With that done, we now shift our attention to the remaining three columns, 'LP_LEBENSPHASE_FEIN', 'WOHNLAGE', and 'PLZ8_BAUMAX', and what we will do to them in the section below. For the 'LP_LEBENSPHASE_FEIN', we do the same methods we did above for this one, but this time the column has three pieces of data being represented, life stage, wealth status, and family stage. So using the same method as above, I create three dictionary mappings to make the original value into a string label representing them. For the life stage levels, I used 'younger_age', 'middle_age', 'advanced_age', and 'retirement_age'. For the family stage, I used 'single', 'couples', 'single_parent', 'family', and 'multihousehold'. Finally for wealth stage, I used 'low', 'average', 'wealthy', and 'top'. These values were mapped to the appropriate matching integer value and saved to their appropriate column. Then my function performed the same steps as it did above, moved them to the same location, removed the original column, and one-hot encoded the column. \n",
    "\n",
    "As for the next two columns, 'WOHNLAGE', and 'PLZ8_BAUMAX', I decided that I would drop the need to drop part of the feature's data meaning. For the 'WOHNLAGE' feature, I decided to convert into two new columns, one for rural or one for neighborhood. I then mapped the values and assigned them to the appropriate column. Effectively, I removed the scoring of the neighborhood and kept it to basically city or no city. For the 'PLZ8_BAUMAX', it was performed basically the exact same steps. I created the two new columns, and they were listed as 'PLZ8_BAUMAX_Family_home' or  ‘PLZ8_BAUMAX_Business'. Effectively, I dropped the amount of housing that was indicated for each value and instead converted it to either family home or business home. Again, moving to the same location, deleting the first column, and one-hot encoding the columns. \n",
    "\n",
    "As for the last column, 'LP_LEBENSPHASE_GROB'. I dropped this column from the dataset since I was keeping the 'LP_LEBENSPHASE_FEIN'. As you recall from above, columns that contain the 'GROB' and 'FEIN' indicate different levels of granularity of the same data. Since I reengineered the 'FEIN' column, I will remove the 'GROB' column. After doing this, we will be done with re-encoding and re-engineering. \n",

    "\n",
    "Before we apply dimensionality reduction techniques to the data, we need to perform feature scaling so that the principal component vectors are not influenced by the natural differences in scale for features. Starting from this part of the project, you'll want to keep an eye on the [API reference page for sklearn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html) to help you navigate to all of the classes and functions that you'll need. In this substep, you'll need to check the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- sklearn requires that data not have missing values in order for its estimators to work properly. So, before applying the scaler to your data, make sure that you've cleaned the DataFrame of the remaining missing values. This can be as simple as just removing all data points with missing data, or applying an [Imputer](https://scikit-learn.org/0.16/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.Imputer.html) to replace all missing values. You might also try a more complicated procedure where you temporarily remove missing values in order to compute the scaling parameters before re-introducing those missing values and applying imputation. Think about how much missing data you have and what possible effects each approach might have on your analysis, and justify your decision in the discussion section below.\n",
    "- For the actual scaling function, a [StandardScaler](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler.html) instance is suggested, scaling each feature to mean 0 and standard deviation 1.\n",
    "- For these classes, you can make use of the `.fit_transform()` method to both fit a procedure to the data as well as apply the transformation to the data at the same time. Don't forget to keep the fit sklearn objects handy, since you'll be applying them to the customer demographics data towards the end of the project."

    "### Discussion 2.1: Apply Feature Scaling\n",
    "\n",
    "Moving into the next section, feature scaling. The reason we need to perform the feature scaling is to normalize all of our features in to a similar range. This is important to remove potential instability caused by vastly different sized data values, which is very important when we are training model to be accurate. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before we can perform our feature scaling, we will need to remove any remaining null values from our dataset. As we were informed in the instructions, there are several different methods we can do this, which was to simply remove the rows that had missing values or impute the missing values. I decided the more accurate method would be to perform the imputation. From here, we are brough to our second choice, do we impute and scale or go complicated and separate the null values from the dataset, create a scaler of the data, then impute the missing data, and apply the scaler to the full dataset. I decided to go with the more complicated method. \n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, I started by first obtaining a count of the missing values from my dataset. This was by performing the is null function with the sum function to get a count of the total nulls per column, then I removed all columns from the results that had zero null values. From here, I took it a step further and created a custom function to generate me a dataframe that contained the column name, the percentage of missing values, the total amount of missing values, the data type the column contains, and the information level of the data. I then used this dataframe, the features summary dataframe, and the data dictionary to review all the 31 columns found to have null values. I performed this review so I could determine what type of data I was using, what the data represented, and what strategy I would use to impute the missing values. To impute the information, I used the 'SimpleImputer' from ski-kit learn and there are two strategies that I will be using to impute the missing data in this project, 'mean' for 'numeric' data and 'most frequency' will be used for 'ordinal' and 'categorical' data. To make this process more fluid, I created another new function to generate lists of the columns for each strategy, numeric and categorical. I also make a third column that is a combination of the two columns. \n",
    "\n",
    "With that done, I start by creating a copy of my dataset by assigning it to a new frame after removing the null values. Next, I imported in the SimpleImputer and create a temporary imputer set to the 'most_frequent' strategy. Next, I perform the fit and transform on the columns from my categorical imputed columns list, applying the new temporary category imputer to those columns. The result of this operation is saved to a new dataframe. The next step I perform is to split my dataset into the numeric columns and all other columns, I do this the same way be filtering by list to either match all or get all but the ones in the list. Once this is done, I then create a new dataframe by concatenating all the three dataframes together. I then perform one-hot encoding on just the category imputed columns. Finally, I can now move on to creating a scaler model and fitting it to my temporary dataframe. \n",
    "\n",
    "With that done, we can move on the next step of this phase of our impute and scale process. Here, I will start by creating a new StandardScaler with the mean strategy and call it numeric imputer. I then fit and transform the numeric imputer onto the main dataset and apply it to just the numeric columns identified before. Next, I create a new category scaler using the 'most_frequent' strategy and perform a fit and transform to all of the categorical/ordinal columns identified before. This is followed by creating a third dataframe that will contain all the columns that did not need imputing or contain any null values. This is followed by the creation of a fourth dataset, which is a concatenation of the three dataset we just created. Once they are joined, I then will perform the one-hot encoding on only the category columns. I utilized the re-index function to filter this dataset to contain only columns that exist inside the scaler that we just created. \n",
    "\n",
    "Speaking of scaler, it is here what I will apply the scaler that we tuned in the previous step onto the full dataset, again filtering the columns to contain only the column who exist in the scaler object's features_names_in. At this point, we are done with the feature scaling phase with a final shape of 281 features. Next, we will move onto PCA. \n",

Try applying it to a small, toy dataset, or use an internet search to help your understanding.\n",
    "- Perform the above two steps for a number of different cluster counts. You can then see how the average distance decreases with an increasing number of clusters. However, each additional cluster provides a smaller net benefit. Use this fact to select a final number of clusters in which to group the data. **Warning**: because of the large size of the dataset, it can take a long time for the algorithm to resolve. The more clusters to fit, the longer the algorithm will take. You should test for cluster counts through at least 10 clusters to get the full picture, but you shouldn't need to test for a number of clusters above about 30.\n",

Once imported the module, we will create an empty list to hold our kmeans score and a second list to hold the number of clusters we would like to check. Then using a loop, we loop through the clusters list items applying the current iterations integer to our kmeans model. As we create our kmeans model with that iterations number of clusters, we then fit the pca data to the model, then calculate the absolute value of the kmeans score and append it to our model score list. We repeat this process until we loop through all of our cluster list item. This is all done on the clustering.py file where I have several versions of this function stored. The function we will use is my second one that has more formatted printing and returns our scores and the range values generated during the loop. \n",

    "At this point, you have clustered data based on demographics of the general population of Germany, and seen how the customer data for a mail-order sales company maps onto those demographic clusters. In this final substep, you will compare the two cluster distributions to see where the strongest customer base for the company is.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the proportion of persons in each cluster for the general population, and the proportions for the customers. If we think the company's customer base to be universal, then the cluster assignment proportions should be fairly similar between the two. If there are only particular segments of the population that are interested in the company's products, then we should see a mismatch from one to the other. If there is a higher proportion of persons in a cluster for the customer data compared to the general population (e.g. 5% of persons are assigned to a cluster for the general population, but 15% of the customer data is closest to that cluster's centroid) then that suggests the people in that cluster to be a target audience for the company. On the other hand, the proportion of the data in a cluster being larger in the general population than the customer data (e.g. only 2% of customers closest to a population centroid that captures 6% of the data) suggests that group of persons to be outside of the target demographics.\n",

Visualizations will be useful here: both for the individual dataset proportions, but also to visualize the ratios in cluster representation between groups. Seaborn's [`countplot()`](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.countplot.html) or [`barplot()`](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.barplot.html) function could be handy.\n",
    "  - Recall the analysis you performed in step 1.1.3 of the project, where you separated out certain data points from the dataset if they had more than a specified threshold of missing values. If you found that this group was qualitatively different from the main bulk of the data, you should treat this as an additional data cluster in this analysis. Make sure that you account for the number of data points in this subset, for both the general population and customer datasets, when making your computations!\n",
    "- Which cluster or clusters are overrepresented in the customer dataset compared to the general population? Select at least one such cluster and infer what kind of people might be represented by that cluster. Use the principal component interpretations from step 2.3 or look at additional components to help you make this inference. Alternatively, you can use the `.inverse_transform()` method of the PCA and StandardScaler objects to transform centroids back to the original data space and interpret the retrieved values directly.\n",

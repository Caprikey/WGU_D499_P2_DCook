### What is RR3?

From Google Search Labs:

    In zoning, "Residential Rural 3" (RR3) generally signifies a type of zoning district that permits low-density, single-family residential development in rural areas. It often allows for agriculture and related uses alongside residential development, according to general code. 

        Key Characteristics of RR3 Zoning:
            Low Density:
                RR3 districts typically allow for fewer dwelling units per acre compared to more urban zoning classifications. 

            Rural Character:
                The zoning aims to maintain a rural character while accommodating residential development. 

            Agricultural Uses:
                Permitted uses often include agricultural activities like animal husbandry, but restrictions may be in place to prevent commercial operations. 

            Accessory Structures:
                RR3 districts may allow for accessory buildings and uses, such as barns or sheds, for agricultural or residential purposes. 

            Minimum Lot Sizes:
                RR3 districts usually require larger lot sizes compared to urban zones, fostering a sense of spaciousness and privacy. 

            Variations in RR3 Zoning:
                Density Limits:
                    RR3 zoning may have specific limitations on the number of dwelling units per acre or on lot coverage. 

            Agriculture Restrictions:
                The type and extent of permitted agricultural uses may vary depending on the specific regulations. 

            Building Height and Setbacks:
                Building height and setback requirements can also vary between RR3 districts. 

            Location Criteria:
                Some jurisdictions may have additional location criteria for RR3 zones, such as avoiding prime farmland or providing transitions between different zoning districts. 

        Examples of RR3 Regulations:
            Minimum Lot Size: A common requirement is a minimum lot size of 25 acres. 
            Maximum Impervious Surface: A limit on the amount of impervious surfaces (like pavement) on a lot may be in place. 
            Building Height: A maximum building height, such as 35 feet, may be specified. 
            Accessory Structures: Accessory structures may be allowed with specific setbacks, such as 50 feet from property lines.
